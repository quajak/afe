afe
===

afe is a very simple PSF font editor written in Python (For python 3.7). It requires wxPython(`pip install wxPython`).

In a font window:

* The left mouse button copies char to the editor.
* The middle button copies from the editor to the font.
* The right button swaps the focused char with the edited one.

The rest is easy.
